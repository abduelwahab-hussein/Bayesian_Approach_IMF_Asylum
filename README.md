# Bayesian_Approach_IMF_Asylum

## Functionality:
**The goal of this project is to demonstrate to the curious person the basics of bayesian econometrics**, both conceptually and analytically. We do this by fitting various bayesian models, trying to elucidate the effect of IMF Loans on immigration, particularly asylum-seeking. The code is written in Python. We use pymc3 for analysis.

## Files:
bayesian_approach.ipynb is the core of this project, with step-by-step bayesian analysis of the data. 
paper.pdf serves as a guide to IMF loans, immigration, and basic linear regression models as it relates to IMF loans and immigration.
final_data.csv is the final dataset.
